# How to debug IoT devices without serial connection

*All the IoT hobbyists must have come across the powerful serial function like "Serial.println()" which prints the data in the serial monitor using TX/RX pins of the microcontroller board. Using this serial monitor data, developers can debug their application properly eg. "Which function/line caused the error". It has some limitations*

How to compile the code for ESP12:

> In the arduino ide select the board as NodeMcuV1.0 ESP12E Then compile the code and upload it to ESP

How to Open Application

> Now Turn the esp in running mode. it will create an access point which you can connect to. Connect to it then open any browser and enter http://192.168.1.1 it will open the application in which you can subscribe the debug channel.

# Happy Debugging :)
